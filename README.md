# Welcome to my analysis on Formula 1 data incluing pole lads, constructors and drivers.

The original data sets are divided in two folders:
1. kaggle_data
2. gpracingstats_data

Our Python Analysis is divided between 3 notebooks:
1. Evolution of fastest laps and pole times
2. Constructors old and new
3. Nationality of drivers

Also included an Excel document with further analysis into the constuctors.

Output datasets from our analysis are included within the exported_data folder.
